## What is VaaS?

Visualization as a Service ("VaaS") is an open-source tool that allows users to monitor their Kubernetes clusters in real-time via powerful performance and cost metrics visualization dashboards. VaaS also offers users a platform-agnostic solution for deploying serverless functions into their clusters via OpenFaaS integration. It will eventually be a one-stop shop for all of your Kubernetes monitoring and maintenance needs.

VaaS is actively being developed with the support of OSLabs and we are always looking for contributors and feedback.

<br/>

## Features

- Monitoring key metrics of multiple clusters from a centralized dashboard
- Graphical visualization of your clusters including all pods, services, deployments, and their status, powered by KubeView
- In-depth graphical visualization of key cluster metrics, powered by Grafana
- Execution of custom queries on your cluster via the Prometheus API
- Monthly cost forcasting by common cost categories, powered by Kubecost
- Deployment, invocation, deletion, and cost estimates of serverless functions via OpenFaaS
